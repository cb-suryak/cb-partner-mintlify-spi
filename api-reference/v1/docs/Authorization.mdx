## Overview
Chargebee employs **HTTP header-based authorization** for all API endpoints related to the Service Adapter. This ensures secure and dynamic management of authorization credentials during API interactions.

## How It Works
- The **Authorization Key** for API calls is dynamically passed in the HTTP header, ensuring secure and seamless integration.
- This key is defined in the `api_configuration` object, which is part of the JSON configuration used during onboarding in Chargebee's marketplace. (Attach link)
- During the app onboarding process in Chargebee, merchants provide the required authorization parameter values.
- The Chargebee app utilizes these values to authenticate and make API calls to the Service Adapter.


## Structure of `credential_configuration`
- The `credential_configuration` is an array of objects, where each object represents a credential parameter.
- Each object includes the following attributes:
    - **`id`**: A unique identifier for the credential (e.g., `authorization_key`, `client_secret`).
    - **`name`**: A descriptive label for the credential.
    - **`type`**: The type of the credential (e.g., `text`).
    - **`is_sensitive`**: Indicates whether the credential is sensitive.

## JSON Configuration Example

```json
{
  "api_configuration": {
    "api_base_url": "https://chargebee.partnerX.com/v1",
    "credential_configuration": [ 
      {
        "id": "api_key",
        "name": "API Key", 
        "type": "text",
        "is_sensitive": true 
      },
      {
        "id": "company_code",
        "name": "Company code",
        "type": "text",
        "is_sensitive": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
