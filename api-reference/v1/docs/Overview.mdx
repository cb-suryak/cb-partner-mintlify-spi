</Note>

## Key Operations

When processing checkout sessions and creating invoices for a merchant’s customer, Chargebee performs the following operations:

- Validate customer shipping addresses for tax calculation.
- Estimate taxes applicable on an invoice and its line items.
- Submit invoice and credit note documents for tax reconciliation.
- Validate customer shipping addresses for product delivery.

Chargebee relies on external tax services to perform these tasks. These services fall into the following categories:

- **Tax Service Providers**: External services offering APIs for tax calculation.
- **In-House Tax Calculation Software**: Custom-built solutions used by merchants.

Chargebee requires a tax service adapter to connect with a tax service. The adapter connects Chargebee and the tax service, using the Tax Service Provider Interface (SPI).

### Building a Tax Service Adapter
To integrate a tax service with Chargebee, you must implement the Tax SPI by creating a tax service adapter app. This is required if you are:

- **A Tax Service Provider**: Integrating your tax service with Chargebee.
- **A Merchant**: Integrating your in-house tax calculation software to Chargebee.
- **A System Integrator**: Developing a connector between a tax service provider and Chargebee.

## JSON Schema for Tax Provider


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based format commonly used to transmit data between web applications and servers. It is both human-readable and machine-parsable.

JSON Schema, a standard established by the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04#:~:text=JSON%20Schema%20is%20a%20JSON,interaction%20control%20of%20JSON%20data), defines the structure and constraints of a JSON document. It describes the expected properties, data types, and rules for interacting with JSON data, ensuring consistency and validity.

Below is the Chargebee Tax Provider JSON Schema. Using this schema ensures that your tax provider data is structured accurately and complies with Chargebee’s platform requirements. This improves data consistency and simplifies integration with other systems or applications.
