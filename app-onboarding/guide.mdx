## Developing an App to Integrate with Chargebee

Chargebee partners can leverage the Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) (Attach link) to develop apps that seamlessly 
integrate with Chargebee. These apps extend Chargebee's core capabilities, enabling diverse business use cases.

To develop your app with Chargebee, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the OpenAPI Specification:**
Familiarize yourself with the OpenAPI spec and integration details to design and build a suitable app for seamless functionality. 
2. **Implement SPI-Defined Endpoints:**
Develop the endpoints as defined in the Service Provider Interface documentation to ensure compatibility with Chargebee's ecosystem.
3. **Adhere to Requirements:**
Review the [General Requirements](#general-Requisites) and [Technical Requirements](#technical-requisites) to ensure your app complies with all guidelines.
4. **Test the Integration:**
Use the provided Postman collection (Attach link) to validate and test the integration.

## Onboarding Process for Apps via SPIs

### General Requisites
To list your app on **Chargebee’s Marketplace** as a solution provider, ensure the following steps are followed:

1. **Compliance with PII Standards**
  - Chargebee is **Personal Identifiable Information (PII) compliant** and mandates its integrated apps to adhere to the same standards.
  - Merchant-specific confidential data shared with partner app servers must be handled securely and in compliance with PII requirements.
  - Your app must provide **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**, particularly addressing **data deletion** requirements, as part of the agreements with both the merchant and Chargebee.

2. **Traffic Management**
  - Partner apps must accept traffic **only from allow-listed servers**, as Chargebee’s infrastructure is designed to operate securely within its ecosystem.

3. **Legal Agreements**
  - A formal legal contract must be signed between Chargebee and the partner app to establish clear terms and conditions.

4. **Responsibilities as a Capability Solution Provider (e.g., Tax Provider)**
  - Independently execute agreements with merchants before they begin using your app.
  - Clearly define the scope of data fetched from Chargebee, including details about customer and sales transaction information.

5. **Pre-Go-Live Deliverables**  
   Share the following details with the Chargebee team before your app goes live:
  - **Escalation Matrix**: Define the escalation process for resolving critical issues.
  - **Merchant Support Email**: Provide a dedicated email for merchant inquiries.
  - **Partner Support Email**: Share an email address for technical support.
  - **Merchant User Guides**: Links to detailed guides for merchants to use your app.
  - **Configuration Documentation**: Documents explaining configurations such as managing API keys and importing plans.

6. **System Status and Maintenance Updates**
  - Maintain a public **external product status page** to communicate system outages and scheduled maintenance.
  - This status page must reflect the health status of both the actual service provider and the app.

7. **Terms, Consent, and Privacy Policies**
  - Publish the following pages on your website:
    - Terms of Service
    - Consent Policy
    - Privacy Policy

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a seamless onboarding process and compliance with Chargebee’s standards for integrating apps into its ecosystem.

### Technical Requisites

1. **Availability**
  - The app’s availability must meet the highest standards, with a target of **99.9% uptime**.
  - If scheduled downtime is required for maintenance, **advance notification** must be provided to Chargebee to minimize the impact on its customers.
  - **Note**: Uninformed downtimes may lead to the app being **delisted** from the marketplace.

2. **Rate Limiting**
  - Chargebee’s enterprise customers can make up to **500 requests per minute**.
  - Tax calculation, being critical to operations, requires integrated apps to handle a minimum of **300 requests per minute per customer**.
  - This capacity will be tested during integration, and it is recommended to ensure the app adheres to this limit.

3. **Latency**
  - apps are expected to respond with a **maximum latency of 250ms** per request.
  - Latencies exceeding this threshold are considered unacceptable.

4. **Quality**
  - Chargebee aims to deliver high-quality tools to its customers.
  - As a listed app in the marketplace, your app must provide a **consistent and positive experience** to merchants.

5. **Scalability**
  - The integrated app must support the same scalability standards as Chargebee.
  - For example, Chargebee supports up to **1200 line items(TBU) per invoice**, and this number is expected to increase.
  - Tax providers should be prepared to scale accordingly and handle at least these volumes, with the capability to adapt to future requirements.

6. **Security & Certifications**
  - All communication must occur over **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** to ensure a secure channel.
  - As Chargebee shares customers’ data, **PII compliance certification** is mandatory to proceed with the agreement.

7. **Concurrency Handling**
  - The app must have the capability to effectively handle **concurrent requests** to ensure smooth operation during peak loads.
