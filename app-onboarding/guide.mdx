## Developing an App to Integrate with Chargebee

Chargebee partners can use the [Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs)](url) to develop apps that seamlessly integrate with Chargebee. These apps extend Chargebee's core capabilities to support diverse business use cases.

### Steps to Develop Your Application

1. **Understand the OpenAPI Specification**: Review the OpenAPI specification and integration details to design and build an app with seamless functionality.
2. **Implement SPI-Defined Endpoints**: Develop endpoints as outlined in the SPI documentation to ensure compatibility with Chargebee’s ecosystem.
3. **Adhere to Requirements**: Review the [General Requirements](https://github.com/cb-suryak/cb-partner-mintlify-spi/pull/9/files#general-requisites) and [Technical Requirements](https://github.com/cb-suryak/cb-partner-mintlify-spi/pull/9/files#technical-requisites) to ensure compliance with Chargebee’s guidelines.
4. **Test the Integration**: Validate and test your integration using the provided [Postman collection](url). 

## Onboarding Process for Apps via SPIs

### General Requisites

To list your app on **Chargebee's Marketplace** as a solution provider, complete the following steps:

1.  **Compliance with PII Standards**
    -   Ensure your app complies with **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** standards.
    -   Handle merchant-specific confidential data securely and in accordance with PII guidelines.
    -   Provide **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** that address data deletion requirements.
2.  **Traffic Management**
    -   Accept traffic **only from allow-listed servers** to maintain secure interactions within Chargebee's ecosystem.
3.  **Legal Agreements**
    -   Sign a formal agreement with Chargebee to establish clear terms and conditions.
4.  **Responsibilities as a Solution Provider**
    -   Execute agreements directly with merchants using your app.
    -   Clearly define the scope of data accessed from Chargebee, including customer and transaction details.
5.  **Pre-Go-Live Deliverables**
    Submit the following details to the Chargebee team:
    -   **Escalation Matrix**: Define critical issue resolution steps.
    -   **Merchant Support Email**: Provide contact information for merchant queries.
    -   **Partner Support Email**: Share a dedicated technical support email.
    -   **Merchant User Guides**: Include links to detailed guides for merchants.
    -   **Configuration Documentation**: Explain configurations such as managing API keys and importing plans.
6.  **System Status and Maintenance Updates**
    -   Maintain a public **external product status page** to communicate system outages and scheduled maintenance. This status page must reflect the health status of both the actual service provider and the application.
7.  **Terms, Consent, and Privacy Policies**
    -   Publish the following policies on your website:
        -   Terms of Service
        -   Consent Policy

### Technical Requisites 

1.  **Availability**
      - Ensure **99.9% uptime** for your app.
      - Provide advance notice for scheduled downtime to minimize disruptions.
      **Note**: Uninformed downtimes may lead to the app being **delisted** from the marketplace. 

2. **Rate Limiting**
    - Support up to **500 requests per minute** for Chargebee's enterprise customers.
    - Ensure tax calculation endpoints handle at least **300 requests per minute per customer**. This capacity will be tested during integration, and it is recommended to ensure the app adheres to this limit.

3. **Latency**
- Respond within a **maximum latency of 250ms** per request. Latencies exceeding this threshold are considered unacceptable.

4. **Quality**
    - Provide a consistent and positive experience to merchants.

5. **Scalability**

    - The integrated app must support the same scalability standards as Chargebee. It must handle up to **1200 line items(TBU) per invoice**, with provisions for future scaling. Tax providers should be prepared to scale accordingly and handle at least these volumes, with the capability to adapt to future requirements.

6. **Security & Certifications**
  - Use **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** for all communication to ensure a secure channel.
  - Obtain **PII compliance certification** to proceed with agreements as Chargebee shares customers’ data.

7. **Concurrency Handling**
  - Ensure your application can handle **concurrent requests** effectively for seamless operation during peak loads.
